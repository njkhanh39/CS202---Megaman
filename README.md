A replicate of Megaman X built using C++. 
The game is my solo project for HCMUS's CS202 Programming Systems course. Since it's my first time building a game from scratch, there are still many places to improve.
Nevertheless, I had fun coding it :D, the game is quite nice (best score among solo projects in my class B) ) and helps me applying OOP concepts such as design patterns into an actual project.
During the project, I also had the chance to try figuring out problems on my own, like coding a physics engine for instance, or handling state pushing from other states, building maps,...
Not the best code organizing (many hard-coded blocks) but cool project anyway. 10/10, would (not) do it again :).
